🧠 AIML Learning Journey – 30 Days of Python, Data & Machine Learning

    Welcome to my AIML learning journey, where I build skills step-by-step for 30 days.
    This repository will grow daily with:
        Python exercises
        Projects
        Notes
        Jupyter notebooks
        ML models
        Data analysis tasks
        My progress & reflections
    By Day 30, this README will contain everything I’ve learned.

    📅 My Daily Progress
        Day 1 – Python Basics
            Learned: variables, data types, strings, numbers, input, lists, list functions
            Completed: 8 Python exercises
            Project: Simple Calculator
            Notes: see day1-notes.md
            Folder: day1-basics/

            ➡️ Status: ✔️ Completed

        Day 2 – NumPy + Pandas + Jupyter Notebook
            Learned: (to be updated)
            Completed: (to be updated)
            Project: (to be updated)
            Folder: day2/

            ➡️ Status: ⏳ Pending (coming next)

        Day 3 – Data Analysis Mini Project
            (To be updated)

        Day 4 – ML Fundamentals
            (To be updated)

        …

        (This will continue till Day 30)
