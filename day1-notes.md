Day 1 – Python Basics (Notes)
    What I Learned Today:
        1. Revised Python fundamentals
        2. Understood variables, data types, and basic operations
        3. Practiced strings, numbers, and input handling
        4. Worked with lists and list functions
        5. Refreshed my understanding of loops and basic logic

    What I Practiced:
        I completed 8 beginner-level Python exercises:
            1. Sum of two numbers
            2. Even/odd checker
            3. Percentage calculator
            4. Printing numbers 1–50
            5. List operations
            6. Dictionary operations
            7. Finding maximum without using max()
            8. Reversing a string manually

    Mini Project:
        Built a Simple Calculator program
        Learned to use loops + if-else + user input together
        Handled errors like division by zero
        Improved confidence in writing small programs independently

    Summary / Reflection:
        Today’s revision refreshed my Python foundation. The exercises helped me regain confidence, and the mini project made me comfortable writing longer logic. Ready for Day-2 (NumPy + Pandas + Jupyter Notebook).
